I recommend using [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) as package manager.

 ```
$ yarn install
```

#### Building the project

First you have to compile es6 that is used in renderer process.

```bash
$ yarn build
```

This will create `main.js` and `counter.js` files in `./dist` folder.  Then you have ro run [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).

```bash
$ yarn package-mac
```
 
 You will find final application in `/release-builds`.
 
 There are also prepared commands for building the application for linux `yarn package-linux` and for windows `yarn package-win`.

#### Development

```bash
$ yarn start
```
 
 If you change code in the `./renderer` folder then you can reload the page using `âŒ˜Cmd + R.`
 
 If you change code in the `./main` folder you might need to restart the electron application.
 
#### Structure

Basically, there are two sections:

__Native environment__:

- `./src/main` Has all _native_ code in one folder.
- `./src/main/main` Has all code needed for _main_ application process.
- `./src/main/counter` Has all code needed for _counter_ application process.
- `./src/main/_shared` Code that is shared between _native_ application processes.

__Renderer environment__:

- `./src/main` Has all views for _renderer_.
- `./src/main/main` Main _view_ folder.
- `./src/main/counter` Counter _view_ folder.
- `./src/main/_shared` Code shared between views.

Code that is shared between renderer and native environment lives in `./src/_shared`.
